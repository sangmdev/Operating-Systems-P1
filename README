What this program does:
///////////////////////
This project is practice using getopt, perror and fork()
The program will fork off versions of itself to do some file processing. 
The original program will read the first line of the file which tells you how many iterations are required. 
The original program will then fork a child process that will
	-take in the next line telling how many integers to read.
	-Read that many integers, putting them on a stack.
	-Write the child PID into the output file.
	-Write the numbers in reverse order into output file.
	-Terminate
The original program will do this until all child procresses have terminated and then write all the pids of children it launched and its own pid to the output file.
